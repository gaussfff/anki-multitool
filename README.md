## Formats
Anki-multitool supports two formats for importing and exporting decks: JSON and Markdown. Full examples you can find in `examples` directory.

### JSON format
Name of file is deck name, so if you want to export deck named "My Deck" to JSON file, it will be saved as `my_deck.json`. 
Vice versa, if you want to import deck from JSON file, the name of the deck will be taken from the file name (without extension).
If deck doesn't exist in Anki, it will be created automatically.

Here is example of JSON format used for importing and exporting decks:
```json
[
    {
      "front": "What is the capital of Urakine?",
      "back": "Kyiv"
    },
    {
      "front": "What is the capital of Germany?",
      "back": "Berlin"
    }
]
```

### Markdown format
Name of file is deck name, so if you want to export deck named "My Deck" to Markdown file, it will be saved as `my_deck.md`.
Vice versa, if you want to import deck from Markdown file, the name of the deck will be taken from the file name (without extension).
If deck doesn't exist in Anki, it will be created automatically.

Here is example of Markdown formats used for importing and exporting decks:
```markdown
1. What is the capital of Ukraine? - Kyiv
2. What is the capital of Germany? - Berlin
```

and 

```markdown
- What is the capital of Ukraine? - Kyiv
- What is the capital of Germany? - Berlin
```
